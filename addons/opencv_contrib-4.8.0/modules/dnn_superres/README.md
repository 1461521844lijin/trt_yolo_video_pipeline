# Super Resolution using Convolutional Neural Networks

This module contains several learning-based algorithms for upscaling an image.

## Usage

Run the following command to build this module:

```make
cmake -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=<opencv_contrib>/modules -Dopencv_dnn_superres=ON <opencv_source_dir>
```

Refer to the tutorials to understand how to use this module.

## Models

There are four models which are trained.

#### EDSR

Trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Saafke/EDSR_Tensorflow/tree/master/models).

- Size of the model: ~38.5MB. This is a quantized version, so that it can be uploaded to GitHub. (Original was 150MB.)
- This model was trained for 3 days with a batch size of 16
- Link to implementation code: https://github.com/Saafke/EDSR_Tensorflow
- x2, x3, x4 trained models available
- Advantage: Highly accurate
- Disadvantage: Slow and large filesize
- Speed: < 3 sec for every scaling factor on 256x256 images on an Intel i7-9700K CPU.
- Original paper: [Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02921.pdf) [1]

#### ESPCN

Trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-ESPCN/tree/master/export).

- Size of the model: ~100kb
- This model was trained for ~100 iterations with a batch size of 32
- Link to implementation code: https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-ESPCN
- x2, x3, x4 trained models available
- Advantage: It is tiny and fast, and still performs well.
- Disadvantage: Perform worse visually than newer, more robust models.
- Speed: < 0.01 sec for every scaling factor on 256x256 images on an Intel i7-9700K CPU.

#### FSRCNN

Trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Saafke/FSRCNN_Tensorflow/tree/master/models).

- Size of the model: ~40KB (~9kb for FSRCNN-small)
- This model was trained for ~30 iterations with a batch size of 1
- Link to implementation code: https://github.com/Saafke/FSRCNN_Tensorflow
- Advantage: Fast, small and accurate
- Disadvantage: Not state-of-the-art accuracy
- Speed: < 0.01 sec for every scaling factor on 256x256 images on an Intel i7-9700K CPU.
- Notes: FSRCNN-small has fewer parameters, thus less accurate but faster.

#### LapSRN

Trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-LapSRN/tree/master/export).

- Size of the model: between 1-5Mb
- This model was trained for ~50 iterations with a batch size of 32
- Link to implementation code: https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-LAPSRN
- x2, x4, x8 trained models available
- Advantage: The model can do multi-scale super-resolution with one forward pass. It can now support 2x, 4x, 8x, and [2x, 4x] and [2x, 4x, 8x] super-resolution.
- Disadvantage: It is slower than ESPCN and FSRCNN, and the accuracy is worse than EDSR.
- Speed: < 0.1 sec for every scaling factor on 256x256 images on an Intel i7-9700K CPU.
