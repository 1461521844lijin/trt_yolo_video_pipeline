Goal
----

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

-   Use the @ref cv::FeatureDetector interface in order to find interest points. Specifically:
    -   Use the cv::xfeatures2d::SURF and its function cv::xfeatures2d::SURF::detect to perform the
        detection process
    -   Use the function @ref cv::drawKeypoints to draw the detected keypoints

\warning You need the <a href="https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib">OpenCV contrib modules</a> to be able to use the SURF features
(alternatives are ORB, KAZE, ... features).
