Goal
----

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

-   Use the @ref cv::DescriptorExtractor interface in order to find the feature vector correspondent
    to the keypoints. Specifically:
    -   Use cv::xfeatures2d::SURF and its function cv::xfeatures2d::SURF::compute to perform the
        required calculations.
    -   Use a @ref cv::DescriptorMatcher to match the features vector
    -   Use the function @ref cv::drawMatches to draw the detected matches.

\warning You need the <a href="https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib">OpenCV contrib modules</a> to be able to use the SURF features
(alternatives are ORB, KAZE, ... features).
