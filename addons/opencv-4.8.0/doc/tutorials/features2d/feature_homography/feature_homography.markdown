Goal
----

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

-   Use the function @ref cv::findHomography to find the transform between matched keypoints.
-   Use the function @ref cv::perspectiveTransform to map the points.

\warning You need the <a href="https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib">OpenCV contrib modules</a> to be able to use the SURF features
(alternatives are ORB, KAZE, ... features).

Explanation
-----------

Result
------

-   And here is the result for the detected object (highlighted in green). Note that since the homography is estimated with a RANSAC approach,
    detected false matches will not impact the homography calculation.
