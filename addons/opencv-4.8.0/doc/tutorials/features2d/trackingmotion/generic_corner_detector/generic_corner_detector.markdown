Goal
----

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

-   Use the OpenCV function @ref cv::cornerEigenValsAndVecs to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    to determine if a pixel is a corner.
-   Use the OpenCV function @ref cv::cornerMinEigenVal to find the minimum eigenvalues for corner
    detection.
-   Implement our own version of the Harris detector as well as the Shi-Tomasi detector, by using
    the two functions above.
