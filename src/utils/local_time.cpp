/* This is a safe version of localtime() which contains no locks and is
 * fork() friendly. Even the _r version of localtime() cannot be used safely
 * in Redis. Another thread may be calling localtime() while the main thread
 * forks(). Later when the child process calls localtime() again, for instance
 * in order to log something to the Redis log, it may deadlock: in the copy
 * of the address space of the forked process the lock will never be released.
 *
 * This function takes the timezone 'tz' as argument, and the 'dst' flag is
 * used to check if daylight saving time is currently in effect. The caller
 * of this function should obtain such information calling tzset() ASAP in the
 * main() function to obtain the timezone offset from the 'timezone' global
 * variable. To obtain the daylight information, if it is currently active or not,
 * one trick is to call localtime() in main() ASAP as well, and get the
 * information from the tm_isdst field of the tm structure. However the daylight
 * time may switch in the future for long running processes, so this information
 * should be refreshed at safe times.
 *
 * Note that this function does not work for dates < 1/1/1970, it is solely
 * designed to work with what time(NULL) may return, and to support Redis
 * logging of the dates, it's not really a complete implementation. */
